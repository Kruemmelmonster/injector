DISCLAMER: 64-bit Windows NT only

I am testing this on Windows 8.
I am pretty confident that the code
will work right on windows 7, but
the PEB structure changed a bit on
windows 8.1 and therefore I am not
sure weather it will work.

If any problems arise contact me via
github and I will be glad to help.

BTW: have you heard of stack probing?
